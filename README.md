# Number Guessing Game In TypeScript
I have made a project of number guessing game in TypeScript. First of all a random number is generated by system and then you have to make a guess between 1 to 10. If your guess becomes right you win the game, otherwise you loose the game. 


## Demo to Project

```bash
What is your guess: 3
The System generated number is: 2
The User guess is: 3
You loose this game!
```
